# Verification-of-MAC-Ethernet-Layer-using-SV-VUM
Functional verification of a 10G Ethernet MAC layer using SystemVerilog UVM. Implemented UVM sequences for MAC frame generation with CRC-32, verified pause frame handling, XGMII interface behavior, and developed functional coverage and assertions. Simulation done using Questasim.
